We are pleased to announce the launch of our newly redesigned website, reflecting our commitment to innovation and providing an enhanced experience for our clients and partners across the insurance sector.

The new site showcases our full range of services, including our specialist fraud investigation capabilities through Zebra SIU, our expertise in connected vehicles and telematics, and our dedicated approach to catastrophic and large loss claims.

As a tech-oriented boutique legal firm, we believe our digital presence should reflect the same standards of excellence and innovation that we bring to our legal practice. The redesigned website offers improved navigation, a cleaner layout, better access to information about our team and the services we provide, and a dedicated News & Insights section to keep our clients and partners informed on the latest developments across the industry.

Colin Bushell, Co-Founder &amp; Director, commented:

> "Our new website is a reflection of who we are – forward-thinking, client-focused, and committed to challenging the status quo. We wanted to create a digital experience that mirrors the quality and innovation our clients expect from us."

The redesigned website was built by Chris Niblock from <a href="https://www.imba-dynamics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IMBA Dynamics</a>.

We invite you to explore the new site and learn more about how Zebra can support your business. If you have any questions or would like to discuss how we can help, please don't hesitate to <a href="/index.html#contact">get in touch</a>.
