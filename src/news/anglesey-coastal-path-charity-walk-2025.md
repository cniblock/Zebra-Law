In September 2025, a team from Zebra Law took on the Anglesey Coastal Path in support of [Milly's Smiles](https://www.millyssmiles.org.uk/), a charity that provides support to families with children undergoing cancer treatment.

The walk proved to be a challenging but rewarding experience. Day 5 brought mixed conditions — starting in difficult weather before warming into a lovely afternoon. Sadly, a medical emergency brought the expedition to a pause before completion, though the team plan to return to finish what they started.

Colin Bushell, Co-Founder & Director, who led the walk, commented:

> "I wanted to pass on a massive thanks to the gents who signed up to this — Mark Frost and Chris Niblock. Amazing effort for such a worthwhile cause. Your company was what made the 98 miles we covered enjoyable rather than sufferable."

The team covered 98 miles in total, and thanks to the generosity of donors, the total raised for Milly's Smiles now stands at **£1,235**.

Colin added:

> "I also want to say a massive thanks to everyone who so generously donated to Milly's Smiles. The final thanks goes to my amazing wife who ran the logistics and support wagon, without which this would have been impossible. She's the real inspiration here as she juggled looking after us and the rest of the family."

At Zebra Law, we believe in giving back to our communities and supporting causes that make a difference. We are proud of our team's efforts and grateful to everyone who contributed to this worthwhile cause.
