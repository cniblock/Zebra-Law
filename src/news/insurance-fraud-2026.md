The insurance fraud landscape continues to evolve at pace, with organised fraud networks becoming increasingly sophisticated in their methods. As we enter 2026, the MGA market faces new challenges that demand innovative responses and cross-industry collaboration.

Recent data suggests that insurance fraud costs the UK industry an estimated £1.2 billion annually, with motor insurance remaining the most targeted sector. However, the nature of fraudulent claims is shifting, with a marked increase in digitally-enabled fraud schemes that exploit gaps in traditional detection methods.

At Zebra, our Special Investigation Unit has observed several emerging trends over the past twelve months. Staged accidents continue to be prevalent, but we are now seeing more sophisticated approaches that leverage technology to fabricate evidence and create convincing false narratives.

> "The fraudsters are becoming more sophisticated, but so are we. Our investment in telematics and data analytics gives us a significant advantage in identifying patterns that would be invisible to traditional investigation methods." — Colin Bushell, Co-Founder &amp; Director

The integration of telematics data into fraud detection has proven transformative. By analysing vehicle data at the point of incident, investigators can rapidly validate or challenge the circumstances of a claim, significantly reducing the window of opportunity for fraudulent activity.

Looking ahead, the industry must continue to invest in technology-led solutions while maintaining the human expertise that remains essential to complex fraud investigations. The combination of advanced analytics, industry databases, and experienced investigators represents the most effective defence against the evolving fraud threat.
