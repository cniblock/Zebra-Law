Zebra Law is pleased to announce that Co-Founder and Director Sunil Nannar has been appointed to a newly formed industry advisory panel focused on fraud prevention across the UK insurance market. The panel, which brings together senior figures from insurers, MGAs, legal services, and law enforcement, has been established to develop best practice guidance and policy recommendations to combat the growing threat of organised insurance fraud.

Sunil's appointment reflects his long-standing commitment to tackling fraud and his recognised expertise in the field. With decades of experience spanning claims management, investigation, and litigation, he brings a unique perspective that bridges the gap between operational reality and strategic policy. His work at Zebra, particularly in building and leading the firm's Special Investigation Unit, has positioned him as one of the leading voices on fraud prevention in the MGA sector.

The advisory panel will focus on several key areas, including the development of industry-wide data sharing standards, the use of technology in fraud detection, and the legal and regulatory frameworks that govern investigation practices. It will also consider the role of education and awareness campaigns in deterring opportunistic fraud, which continues to account for a significant proportion of fraudulent claims.

> "Fraud is not just an insurance problem — it's a societal problem that drives up costs for honest policyholders and diverts resources away from genuine claimants. I'm honoured to contribute to this panel and to help shape an industry response that is both effective and proportionate." — Sunil Nannar, Co-Founder &amp; Director

The panel's work is expected to produce its first set of recommendations within six months, with a particular focus on improving collaboration between the private and public sectors. Sunil has long advocated for greater information sharing between insurers, and he sees the panel as an important step towards breaking down the silos that have historically hampered the industry's collective response to fraud.

For Zebra, Sunil's appointment is a further endorsement of the firm's standing in the market and its commitment to leading the fight against insurance fraud. The insights gained from the panel's work will directly inform Zebra's own practices and the advice it provides to its MGA clients, ensuring that the firm remains at the cutting edge of fraud prevention strategy.
