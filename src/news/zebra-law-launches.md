We are delighted to announce the official launch of Zebra Law, a tech-oriented boutique legal firm built with a clear vision: to redefine the standards of legal partnership within the Defendant PI market.

Founded by Colin Bushell and Sunil Nannar, Zebra Law brings together decades of experience across the insurance and legal sectors. Our mission is to challenge the traditional panel model and offer a genuinely different approach — one built on agility, transparency, and strategic alignment with our clients' goals.

Colin Bushell, Co-Founder & Director, commented:

> "We saw an opportunity to do things differently. The insurance market, particularly the MGA space, deserves legal partners who truly understand their business and can move at the same pace. That's exactly what Zebra was built to deliver."

Sunil Nannar, Co-Founder & Director, added:

> "From day one, our focus has been on building a firm that prioritises innovation, professional excellence, and genuine partnership. We're not just another legal provider — we're an extension of our clients' teams."

Zebra Law is headquartered in Wilmslow, Cheshire, and offers a comprehensive suite of services tailored to the needs of the insurance sector, including fraud investigation, connected vehicle and telematics expertise, catastrophic and large loss claims management, and complex strategic litigation.

We are committed to fostering a culture of professional excellence and strategic alignment, driving innovation, enhancing market differentiation, and integrating ESG principles into our executive function.

We look forward to working with our clients and partners to deliver unparalleled results. To find out more about Zebra Law and how we can support your business, please <a href="/index.html#contact">get in touch</a>.
