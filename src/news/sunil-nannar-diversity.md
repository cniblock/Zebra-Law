Diversity and inclusion have become central tenets of modern business strategy, yet the legal profession has historically lagged behind other sectors in making meaningful progress. Sunil Nannar, Co-Founder and Director of Zebra Law, believes that building a genuinely diverse and inclusive organisation is not simply a matter of compliance — it is a fundamental driver of better outcomes for clients and for the profession as a whole.

At Zebra, diversity is woven into the fabric of the business from the ground up. The firm's leadership team reflects a range of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives, and this diversity is actively cultivated at every level of the organisation. Sunil is clear that this is not about ticking boxes, but about creating an environment where different viewpoints are valued and where talent can thrive regardless of background.

The legal services sector, and particularly the insurance litigation space, has traditionally been dominated by a narrow demographic. Sunil argues that this lack of diversity has contributed to a profession that can be slow to innovate and resistant to change. By contrast, Zebra's diverse team brings fresh thinking and a willingness to challenge established norms, which in turn benefits the clients they serve.

> "Diversity isn't a programme or an initiative at Zebra — it's who we are. When you bring together people with different life experiences, different perspectives, and different ways of thinking, you get better solutions. Our clients see the benefit of that every day." — Sunil Nannar, Co-Founder &amp; Director

Zebra's commitment to diversity and inclusion is closely aligned with its broader ESG principles. The firm has implemented policies that promote flexible working, support mental health and wellbeing, and ensure that recruitment practices are free from unconscious bias. These initiatives are not only the right thing to do, Sunil notes, but they also make strong commercial sense in a competitive market for talent.

Looking to the future, Sunil is keen to see the wider legal profession take bolder steps towards genuine inclusion. He advocates for greater transparency in diversity reporting, more mentoring and sponsorship programmes for underrepresented groups, and a willingness among industry leaders to have honest conversations about the barriers that still exist. For Zebra, the commitment to diversity and inclusion remains non-negotiable and central to its identity.
