Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles have moved from the periphery of corporate strategy to its very centre, and the legal profession is no exception. Joanna Nannar, Director at Zebra Law, has been a driving force behind the firm's commitment to embedding ESG considerations into every aspect of its operations, from the way it serves its clients to the way it manages its own business.

For Joanna, ESG is not a box-ticking exercise or a marketing initiative — it is a fundamental reflection of the values that Zebra was built upon. The firm's approach encompasses environmental responsibility, with a commitment to reducing its carbon footprint through digital-first working practices and minimal reliance on physical offices, as well as a strong focus on social responsibility through its diversity and inclusion programmes and community engagement.

The governance pillar is equally important. Zebra has implemented robust compliance frameworks, transparent reporting structures, and ethical decision-making processes that ensure the firm operates to the highest standards. This commitment to good governance is particularly significant in the legal sector, where trust and integrity are the foundation of every client relationship.

> "ESG isn't something we bolt on to our business — it's embedded in everything we do. From how we recruit and develop our people, to how we manage our environmental impact, to how we govern our operations. Our clients increasingly expect their legal partners to share these values, and we're proud to lead by example." — Joanna Nannar, Director

Joanna notes that ESG considerations are becoming increasingly important in the insurance sector, with MGAs and their capacity providers paying closer attention to the sustainability credentials of their supply chain. Legal services providers that can demonstrate a genuine commitment to ESG principles are finding themselves at a competitive advantage, as clients seek partners whose values align with their own.

Looking ahead, Joanna is focused on deepening Zebra's ESG commitments. Plans include the development of a formal sustainability strategy with measurable targets, expanded partnerships with charitable organisations, and further investment in the wellbeing and professional development of the firm's people. For Joanna, this is not just good business practice — it is the right thing to do, and it is what sets Zebra apart in a crowded market.
