In August 2024, a team from Zebra Law took on the Yorkshire Three Peaks Challenge — scaling Pen-y-ghent, Whernside, and Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales in a single day. It was a fantastic day of teamwork, determination, and fundraising for a worthy cause.

Thanks to the generosity of donors, the team's fundraising reached the **£500** mark — a brilliant achievement. Every donation, no matter how big or small, made a real difference, and the team are super grateful to everyone who contributed.

Colin Bushell, Co-Founder & Director, commented:

> "I wanted to say a massive thanks to Mark & Emma from [Treks to The Wrecks](https://lnkd.in/e6mmsdAM) for their support and expert guidance throughout the day. I've worked with a few mountain leaders before on similar events — I couldn't recommend Mark & Emma highly enough. Well done team."

The Yorkshire Three Peaks Challenge takes in Pen-y-ghent, Whernside, and Ingleborough — a classic 24.5-mile route through the Yorkshire Dales, typically completed in under 12 hours. Here's how the Zebra Law team fared:
