Zebra's Special Investigation Unit (SIU) has announced a significant expansion of its fraud investigation capabilities for the vehicle insurance sector. The move comes as fraud losses across the UK economy are estimated to exceed £190 billion annually, with growing demand for specialist investigative expertise in an era of increasingly complex and cross-border fraudulent activity.

Zebra SIU is led by Chris Hallett, who brings over 30 years' experience investigating fraud. The unit has been established to provide insurers and MGAs in the vehicle insurance sector with a dedicated, intelligence-led capability focused on complex and high-value fraud risk.

Leveraging access to industry-leading databases, investigative tools and specialist intelligence resources, Zebra SIU delivers structured, evidence-based intelligence reports. These can be commissioned as a standalone product or deployed in support of defendant litigation managed by Zebra Law, ensuring seamless integration between investigation strategy and legal execution.

Zebra SIU provides a disciplined and cost-effective mechanism for targeted fraud investigation. Our reporting is clear, defensible and aligned to claims strategy, supporting claimant profiling, early decision-making, reserve accuracy and, where appropriate, robust repudiation or litigation.

We regularly support vehicle insurance clients with flexible, bespoke reporting across: insurance policy and claims fraud; complex fraud; large loss; credit hire; and theft.

> "Our SIU was born out of a need we identified within the vehicle insurance market. This expansion strengthens our capability to support insurers and MGAs with targeted fraud investigation at a time when the sector faces increasingly sophisticated fraud risk." — Sunil Nannar, Co-Founder &amp; Director
