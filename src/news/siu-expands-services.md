Zebra's Special Investigation Unit (SIU) has announced a significant expansion of its fraud investigation capabilities, extending its services beyond the insurance sector to serve clients across both the public and private sectors. The move reflects growing demand for specialist investigative expertise in an era of increasingly complex and cross-border fraudulent activity.

Founded on over 30 years of combined experience in fraud detection and prevention, the SIU has built a formidable reputation within the MGA insurance market. Its team of former law enforcement professionals and experienced claims investigators brings a unique blend of skills that few competitors can match, combining rigorous investigative methodology with deep industry knowledge.

The expanded service offering includes corporate fraud investigations, asset tracing, due diligence checks, and litigation support for organisations outside the traditional insurance space. Local authorities, housing associations, and private businesses will now be able to access the same calibre of investigative resource that has made Zebra's SIU a trusted partner for leading MGAs.

> "Our SIU was born out of a need we identified within the insurance market, but the skills and methodologies we have developed are applicable far beyond that sector. Fraud does not respect industry boundaries, and neither should the response to it. This expansion allows us to bring our expertise to a much wider audience." — Sunil Nannar, Co-Founder &amp; Director

Central to the expansion is the unit's investment in technology. Zebra's SIU leverages advanced data analytics, open-source intelligence tools, and telematics data to build comprehensive evidential packages. This technology-first approach enables faster turnaround times and more robust outcomes, whether the investigation relates to a staged motor accident or a complex corporate fraud scheme.

The announcement comes at a time when fraud losses across the UK economy are estimated to exceed £190 billion annually, with public sector organisations increasingly targeted by sophisticated criminal networks. Zebra's SIU is well positioned to meet this growing challenge, offering a flexible and cost-effective alternative to traditional investigative firms.
