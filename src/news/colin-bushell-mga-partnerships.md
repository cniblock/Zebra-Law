With over 20 years of experience in the insurance and legal sectors, Colin Bushell has witnessed first-hand how the relationship between insurers, MGAs, and their legal partners has evolved. As Co-Founder and Director of Zebra Law, Colin has been instrumental in challenging the status quo and building a consultancy that prioritises agility, transparency, and genuine partnership over the traditional panel model.

The MGA market has grown significantly in recent years, yet many managing general agents still find themselves constrained by legal service providers who operate on outdated partnership structures. These legacy models often result in slow response times, inflated costs, and a disconnect between the legal team and the commercial realities of the MGA's business. Colin recognized early on that this gap represented both a problem and an opportunity.

At Zebra, the approach is fundamentally different. Rather than positioning itself as a remote panel firm, the company embeds itself within its clients' operations, working as an extension of their in-house teams. This model allows for faster decision-making, more commercially aware legal advice, and a deeper understanding of the risks and pressures that MGAs face on a daily basis.

> "The traditional legal panel model is broken for MGAs. They need partners who understand the pace at which they operate and who are willing to share in both the risk and the reward. That's what we set out to build with Zebra — a legal consultancy that truly works alongside its clients, not at arm's length." — Colin Bushell, Co-Founder &amp; Director

Colin's vision extends beyond simply offering legal services. He has championed the integration of technology into every aspect of Zebra's operations, from telematics-driven claims investigations to data analytics that inform litigation strategy. This forward-thinking approach has enabled the firm to deliver measurable outcomes for its MGA clients, reducing indemnity spend and improving claims cycle times.

Looking ahead, Colin sees continued disruption in the legal services market as MGAs demand more from their partners. The firms that will thrive, he argues, are those that can combine deep sector expertise with the flexibility and innovation that the modern insurance landscape requires. It is a philosophy that has guided Zebra from its inception and one that continues to drive its growth.
