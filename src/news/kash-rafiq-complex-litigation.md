Complex litigation in the insurance claims landscape demands a rare combination of legal expertise, commercial awareness, and strategic thinking. Kash Rafiq, Senior Litigation Manager at Zebra Law, has built a career navigating the most challenging cases in the sector, from multi-party disputes and high-value personal injury claims to intricate fraud conspiracies that require months of careful preparation.

Kash's approach to complex litigation is rooted in meticulous preparation and a deep understanding of the commercial objectives of Zebra's MGA clients. Unlike traditional panel solicitors who may take a purely legalistic view, Kash works to ensure that every litigation strategy is aligned with the client's broader business goals — whether that means pursuing an aggressive defence to set a market precedent or negotiating a pragmatic settlement to contain costs.

One area where Kash has made a particular impact is in the management of special projects — large-scale litigation exercises that involve coordinating multiple cases with common themes or defendants. These projects often arise in the context of organised fraud rings, where dozens or even hundreds of linked claims must be investigated, evidenced, and litigated in a coordinated manner to achieve the best possible outcomes.

> "Complex litigation isn't just about knowing the law — it's about understanding the bigger picture. Every case sits within a commercial context, and the best outcomes come when you combine legal rigour with a clear-eyed view of what the client needs to achieve. That's what drives my approach at Zebra." — Kash Rafiq, Senior Litigation Manager

Cost control is a constant thread running through Kash's work. He has been instrumental in developing Zebra's approach to litigation budgeting and cost management, ensuring that clients have full visibility of costs at every stage and that resources are deployed where they will have the greatest impact. This disciplined approach has delivered significant savings for Zebra's MGA clients, particularly on complex multi-track cases where costs can escalate rapidly if not carefully managed.

As the claims landscape continues to evolve, Kash sees technology playing an increasingly important role in complex litigation. From AI-assisted document review to telematics evidence that can make or break a fraud case, the tools available to litigators are more powerful than ever. The challenge, he argues, is ensuring that these tools are used effectively and ethically, and that the human judgment at the heart of good litigation is never lost in the pursuit of technological efficiency.
