Catastrophic and large loss claims represent some of the most challenging and sensitive cases in the insurance industry. When a life-changing injury occurs or a claim runs into six or seven figures, the stakes are extraordinarily high for all parties involved. Zebra Law has developed a distinctive approach to managing these cases, one that combines a crisis-response mindset with deep legal expertise and genuine compassion for those affected.

From the moment a large loss notification is received, Zebra's team activates a rapid-response protocol designed to secure critical evidence and establish the facts of the case as quickly as possible. This includes immediate engagement with telematics data providers, accident reconstruction specialists, and medical experts. The first 24 to 48 hours of a catastrophic claim are often the most critical, and the actions taken during this window can define the trajectory of the entire case.

Central to Zebra's approach is the recognition that behind every large loss claim is a human story. Whether the injured party is the insured or a third-party claimant, the team is trained to handle every interaction with empathy and professionalism. This is not just a matter of ethics — it is also sound commercial practice. Claims that are handled with care and transparency from the outset are far less likely to become adversarial and costly, and are more likely to reach fair and timely resolution.

> "Large loss claims require a different mindset. You need to move quickly, think strategically, and never lose sight of the fact that real people are affected. Our approach is to bring the rigour of a crisis response together with the humanity that these cases demand." — Sunil Nannar, Co-Founder &amp; Director

Telematics and connected vehicle data play an increasingly important role in Zebra's large loss work. In cases involving catastrophic motor incidents, ECU data can provide an objective and detailed account of the collision dynamics, helping to establish liability and quantify damages with a level of precision that was previously unattainable. This evidence is often pivotal in achieving early resolution and avoiding protracted and expensive litigation.

Zebra's large loss team works closely with its MGA clients to provide regular and transparent reporting throughout the lifecycle of each claim. Reserving accuracy, proactive case management, and clear communication are the cornerstones of this relationship, ensuring that clients are never caught off guard by developments in their most significant exposures. It is an approach that has earned the trust of some of the UK's leading managing general agents.
