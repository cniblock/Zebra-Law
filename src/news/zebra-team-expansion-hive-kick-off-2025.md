Zebra Law is thrilled to announce two outstanding additions to our growing team as we continue to strengthen our position as a leading innovator and disruptor in counter-fraud legal services.

**Chris Hallett** joins as a senior leader, widely recognised as one of the industry's top intelligence and investigative specialists. With an impressive track record and unparalleled expertise, Chris is here with a clear mandate: to elevate and expand our innovative and bespoke counter-fraud services for the MGA Insurance sector and many associated service providers.

We are equally delighted to welcome **Finlee Gotham** as our new full-time Intelligence Analyst. Finlee's role adds greater depth to our capability to deliver actionable insights and tailored solutions for our clients.

This exciting milestone follows our incredibly successful 2025 Kick Off session held at the fantastic Hive 365 offices in Handforth on Monday. Huge thanks to Paul Prior and the team for hosting the Zebra Dazzle in what was an energised and hugely rewarding day.

As we enter 2025, Zebra is officially open for business — ready to support your organisation and partner with you to deliver innovative, results-driven legal solutions. If you're seeking fresh perspective and impactful outcomes, we'd love to <a href="/index.html#contact">connect</a>.
