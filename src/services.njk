              <h2>Connected Vehicle / Automation</h2>
              <p>
                Within the realm of Connected Vehicles, our dedication lies in harnessing
                cutting-edge technology and data analytics. Our expertise spans telematics to
                comprehensive ECU interrogation where we have the capacity to gather diverse vehicle
                data tailored to specific makes and models. This enables Zebra to furnish our
                clients with actionable insights and strategic guidance, empowering them to make
                informed decisions and mitigate risks effectively. We are committed to significantly
                reducing traditional legal spend and claims expense by equipping clients with
                invaluable insights to proactively manage their risk profiles.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreover, in the realm of Automation, we possess market-leading expertise in
                autonomous vehicles, understanding the challenges faced by OEMs and insurers alike.

                stemming from automation and other technological advancements.

              <h2>Catastrophic / Large Loss</h2>
              <p>
                Catastrophic and large loss claims demand decisive leadership, technical precision
                and disciplined cost control. These matters carry significant financial, operational
                and reputational exposure. We provide strategic oversight from the outset, delivering
                clear, commercially grounded advice throughout the life of the claim.
              </p>
              <p>
                Drawing on our expertise in complex liability analysis, evidential strategy and the
                forensic application of telematics and other data sources, we adopt a structured
                crisis-response approach. Early case assessment, robust reserving support and
                defined litigation pathways ensure Claims Teams retain control at every stage.
              </p>
              <p>
                We operate as an integrated partner to insurers and MGAs, working in close
                collaboration with internal Claims Teams and leveraging our strategic partnerships
                across forensic investigation, intelligence, medical experts and rehabilitation
                providers. This coordinated model strengthens defensibility, sharpens indemnity
                management and reduces lifecycle cost.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our focus is disciplined execution: early identification of risk drivers, containment
                of exposure, and resolution strategies aligned to commercial objectives. The
                result is controlled outcomes in complex, high-value claims environments.
